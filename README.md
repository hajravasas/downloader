```

**For Service Account:**

- Enter the path to your service account JSON key file
- Default: `service-account-key.json`

**For OAuth:**

- A browser window will open for authentication
- Sign in with your Google account
- Grant the necessary permissions

### Downloading Files

1. **Enter Google Drive folder:**

   - You can enter either the folder name: `My Photos`

2. **Enter local download path:**
   - Specify where you want files saved, no double quotes
   - Examples:
     - `./downloads` (relative path)
     - `/Users/username/Downloads/MyFiles` (absolute path)
     - `"/Volumes/External Drive/Backup"` (external drive with spaces)

### Finding Google Drive Folder ID

If you prefer using folder IDs instead of names:

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Navigate to your folder
3. Look at the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID_HERE`
4. Copy the ID portion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Folder not found"**

- Ensure the folder name is spelled correctly
- For service accounts: Make sure you shared the folder with the service account email
- Try using the folder ID instead of the name

**"Permission denied"**

- For service accounts: The service account needs at least "Viewer" access to the folder
- For OAuth: Make sure you granted the necessary permissions during authentication

**"Service account key file not found"**

- Check the file path you entered
- Ensure the JSON key file is in the correct location
- Verify the filename is correct

**"OAuth access denied / Error 403"**

- Add yourself as a test user in the OAuth consent screen
- Make sure you're using the correct Google account
- Try the "Go to [app name] (unsafe)" option in the browser warning

**Files downloading to wrong location**

- Check that the path exists and is writable
- Use quotes around paths with spaces: `"/path/with spaces/"`
- Try using absolute paths instead of relative paths

### Debug Mode

The script includes debug information to help troubleshoot path issues:

```
üìç Attempting to save files to: /your/specified/path
üìç Full absolute path: /full/resolved/path
‚úì Target directory ready: /your/specified/path
```

## Security Notes

- **Service Account Keys**: Keep your JSON key files secure and never share them publicly
- **OAuth Tokens**: The script stores authentication tokens locally in `token.json`
- **Permissions**: The script only requests read-only access to your Google Drive
